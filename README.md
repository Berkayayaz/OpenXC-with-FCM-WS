# OpenXC-with-FCM-WS


OpenXC is a combination of open source hardware and software that lets you extend your vehicle with custom applications and pluggable modules.

Web Socket Messaging and Firsebase Cloud Messaging functions added.


Basically, the app is based on OpenXC open source code and I upgraded it to be able to send and receive messages to server via Web Socket(WIFI) or Firebase Cloud Messaging.
